### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there

Lifetime developer, Sci-fi addicted, cat squeezer, the last baklava bender, good lyrics detector, meeting doodler, bench activist, entrepreneur-ish.

### :cat: Who am I?

Hola Amigos! Kon'nichiwa! I'm a freelance consultant, software Merlin, architectural samurai, conference Ryan Reynolds, instructor extraordinaire, and open-source enthusiast based in the charming city of The Hague, The Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± (Yes, "the" in both). With nearly two decades of experience, I've mastered the art of juggling code and orchestrating digital symphonies.

As the maestro behind [Fria Tech](https://fria.io), [Repsy](https://repsy.io), and co-founder of [Zyfera](https://zyfera.com) and [MagicAccents](https://magicaccents.com), I've left my digital footprint across the landscape of technology. My playground includes the realms of Web, SaaS, Cloud, Microservices, Java, Kotlin, TypeScript and the Spring Framework, where I've contributed so often that they practically named a coffee blend after me. I even unveiled the magical [Lilo](https://github.com/friatech/lilo), an open-source GraphQL stitching library, at the prestigious [SpringOne 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GQpxqORlr0).

But wait, there's more! I'm not just a Java superhero; I've wielded the mighty frontend Mjolnir and battled through the JavaScript backend realm like a tech Avenger. For over 15 years, I've been the Tony Stark of my computers, suiting up with the Linux Iron Man armor. DevOps and GitOps are my superpowers, and I've even added some extra flair with a dash of programming language creation because even superheroes need their secret language.

In the parallel universe of company creation, I've founded not one, not two, not three, but four companies. (Well, 2 of them failed) And just to keep things interesting, I've conjured up an OpenStack-like VM orchestrator for my Cloud Computing Company, Codvio. As a hobby project, I have created a very basic Operating System called PotatOS and a Commodore64 emulator in JavaScript.

I have a cat named Minnosh (cutified (if there's such a word) version of "mini" in Turkish). I love sports cars, and motorbikes and do like painting or wrapping things that I care about. Unlike most of the nerds, I like drawing stuff. Can't say very good at hand drawings but It's really fun to use the open-source vector graphics program [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
